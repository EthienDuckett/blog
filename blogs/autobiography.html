			<h1>Autodidact</h1>
			<p>Believe it or not, I spend most of my time at home programming or reading. It has affected me in two ways: <br>
			1. I learn phenomenally by myself. <br> 
			2. I cannot tolerate mediocre materials and teachers. <br>
			I think that having become more picky has benefitted me a lot. If you would like to see how, then you can recommend that I learn something. I may or may not follow your advice, but of course you can motivate me with an opportunity such as a competition, collaboration, internship, and or job offer. I think I could stand to learn more about education, so I am compelled to beta test an online course and provide useful feedback.

		<div class="sect"><h1>School</h1>
			<p>I attend school at Caldwell Applied Sciences Academy high school and Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute. There are three academies at my high school, the one I am in is the Advanced Technologies Academy. In my academy, we learn about software. It is instructed mostly by Guy Meyers who you can find in the teacher's websites tab of the school website. The academies are part of a dual-enrollment program which is designed to prepare students for the future by giving them an opportunity to get college credits, some certifications, and an associates degree potentially before graduation.<br>
			As of April 30, 2022, I have completed the following projects in my academy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EthienDuckett/AddressFinder-Derailed">Follow a YouTube Swift app design tutorial</a></li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EthienDuckett/Apple_Pie">Apple Pie SwiftUI programming project</a></li>

		<h1>Programming Preferences</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>My favorite language is C</li>
			<li>I prefer python scripts to shell scripting (in bash) but I usually have no need to use python for some simple linux tasks</li>
			<li>I prefer programming with neovim (CLI)</li>
			<li>I prefer the procedural programming paradigm because it produces the most reusable and modifiable code even if I have to search and replace</li>
			<li>I only program in GNU/Linux</li>
			<li>I prefer Ubuntu, but I might switch to Arch someday</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Noes (least No to most No)</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>One liners</li>
			<li>Advanced Python OOP/MRO</li>
			<li>Common Lisp</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>private/public/protected encapsulation (I only use real scope, none of this pseudo-scope)</li>
			<li>Windows API</li>
		</ul>
